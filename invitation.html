<p class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> <b>Blue Ridge Community Church Project</b> <br> This was an invitation for the kids to pass out to their friends. We came together and produced a large production on this particular morning. We gave out prizes, and played carnival games. This was displayed via projection, and printed on small cards and distributed. </p>
