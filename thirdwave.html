<h1 class="text-center"> Third Wave Coffee </h1>
<p class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 20px;"> <b>Client Project</b> <br> I was asked to create a branding for a new coffee shop in Forest, VA. This is a more modern coffee shop, with lots of the old traditions of coffee. Third Wave is a coffee movement making coffee more of a delicacy than a commodity. I was privileged to help craft the vision and direction of the branding and website design for this exciting new company. </p>
