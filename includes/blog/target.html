<h2> Designing for an Audience </h2>
    
<p>Thinking of who you’re targeting is perhaps the most important decision on the road to success with a new business. You won’t get too far if you start up a coffee shop, and all of your branding and feel is directed towards children. </p>

    <p>First things first: do the research. Come to the bottom line of who’s going to buy what you’re selling. <br> <h3 style="text-align:center;">If you’re selling Life Alert, you’re likely not going to target anyone under 70.</h3><br>  Once you’ve found out who is going to be buying your product or service, find out what they like! Find TV shows they’re interested in, places they frequent, do they shop online or in store? Once you find out tons of information about your audience, you can start using that to your advantage to get those people coming into your shop!</p>

<p>Most of my design career, i’ve been working in a children’s ministry at a church. Working with your audience being kindergarten - fifth grade can be an interesting way to stretch a fresh-out-of-college designer. I had so many ideas, so many really cool styles I had seen studying other designers, and wanted my style to be the same way.
</p>

<p>I had looked up to those designers because they had targeted me within their audience and they captivated me with their subtle details, and clever little jokes inside of the design. I was always taken back when I had pitched something similar to the directors, and always got it back, saying it was “too adult”. 
</p>

<p> I also really loved muted, faded colors. Some of the things that I made you might see hanging in your favorite coffee shop, or a lounge of sorts, while it seemed boring to children. </p>

<p>I finally started to learn. I’d spice up some of my work with bright, simple colors. I had lots of details, but they were obvious, and easy to understand. I used large, bold, and expressive letterforms that helped the kids remember what they saw, whether it was a Bible verse or a title of a series. 
</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;"> It all comes down to even the smallest of details, consistency is key.</h3><p> You have to think of everything, whether it is the usability or your website, or how your colors are going to look in advertisements, or even on the walls of your shop. You really have to dive into the culture of your audience, and start to enjoy what they enjoy, and hate what they hate. </p>

<p>Once you’ve found out what they like, you have to find out what you’re good at! This is especially true for designers. If you’re an amazing calligrapher, but can’t code, you probably shouldn’t offer web design services just to make your customers happy. The sweet spot you’re looking for is what you’re good at, mixed in with what your customers are looking for. </p>
    
<p>OK, if you walk away with anything from this, I would like it to be: do your homework! Go buy magazines, visit places your customers also visit. Listen to their music, their movies. The more information you have, the more successful you’ll be catering to them.
